1. react-router-dom

2. antd - ui framework

3. redux
It is a Predictable State Container for JS Apps.
Predictable --> because it helps you write applications that behave consistently, 
and can run in different environments (client, server, and native).
    Centralized --> because of this feature, 
    we don't need to lift state to parent components 
    and we can use state from any component we want due to this centralized behavior.
    Debuggable --> There is an extension called Redux DevTools 
    which is an excellent tool to debug Redux applications. 
    Using this tool you can see when, where, why, and how your application's state changed.
    Flexible --> because it works with any UI layer, and has a large ecosystem of addons.

4. react-redux -  It allows React components to read data from a Redux Store, 
and dispatch Actions to the Store to update data. 

5.redux-thunk - middleware for Redux.

6. axios - Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser.
It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase).
On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, 
while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.
