### Description: 
    Full Stack website deployed on Heroku created with Bootstrap, React.js, MongoDB, and Node.js. 
    Firstly, In this app, you have to create a new account (or use default Messi), 
    and then you have to log in to access the website. “Baran Book” imitates 'Instagram' 
    you can like others' posts, find different people, follow them, and check who is following you. 
    In this case, I used external image hosting “Cloudinary” to store Base64 strings and receive URLs to images.
    The website is responsive, includes animation of the card and it is all adapted to mobile devices
